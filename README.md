## Uber Data Analysis

This notebook contains analysis of Uber trip data in Ney York City using Python and the analysis has 3 parts:
 1. Data Loading and preparation 
* The dataset can be found https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visulaization
* Various data visualizations have been performed leveraging python packages such as Plotly, Seaborn - for heat maps,  Folium, Geopy - for Geo spatial analysis

 3. Deriving insights to make business decisions 
- Following are the insights derived from the Analysis: 
- Generated monthly, weekly, daily, hourly plots of Uber trips and noticed that:
  * rides were higher on Thursday 
  * rides were peak during evening time
  * Apparently, September has maximum rides
  * By analyzing the location from spatial analysis, it is observed that maximum Uber rides were from Manhattan
